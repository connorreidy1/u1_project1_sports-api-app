Scottish Premiership APP

I've created a simple sports app for the Scottish Premiership football league. You can see the roster of players fo reach team, the league standings, and game schedule for all upcoming games.

All content, with a couple of text exceptions, is pulled from the the api.

The homepage has a header with the league logo and name, a subheader with clickable links to 'Standings' and 'Schedule'. In the main body of the page is an alphabetically list of the teams. Each is clickable at takes your to an individual team page.

On each team page the team logo, team name, stadium, and city/country information has been pulled from the api. in the body of the team page is the team's roster, listing all of the players on the team, their picture, name, jersey number, and abbreviation of their position.

On the standings page the teams are listed in order of current position in the leaue, their logo, name, and current points.

On the schedule page there is a list of games contained within their own divs. Each fixture displays the match name, logos for each team, the date, time and location of each match.
